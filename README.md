## APP OVERVIEW & NOTES:
- this is a speech-to-text ai assistant chatbot desktop app designed to act as a copilot with the ability to access external web services and also interact with files and browsers on the user's computer.
- it can act as a note taker, question answerer, research assistant, information organizer/retriever, task automator, etc. 
- It's the basis for a jarvis-like ai assistant that can be extended with any number of attitional tools and features. 
- The app contains a collection of agents and tools that work together to provide a range of functionality as one cohesive experience.
- The tools available to the bot exist in the chatbot_tools module. 
- The tools are called by the chatbot_model.keras and the agents themselves based on specific verbal prompts from the user.
- The agents are powered by LLM APIs like gemini and openai. 
- When the larger LLMs are called, they enter a sub-loop with the user and can be used to search the web, answer questions, or have a conversation with the user.
- The chatbot_intents.json file is a collection of possible user phrases and responses that are used to train the app's base model.
- The first model that the user interacts with is a smaller model trained locally on the hard-coded chatbot_intents.json file which contains sets of phrase / response pairs for the initial chatbot. Some responses also trigger calls to static methods from the ChatBotTools class.
- All of the available functions are listed below in detail.
- The chatbot_model.keras model is the first model to activate when the app is run and acts as the "router" and function caller for triggering tools or more complex agents based on user commands. 
- They also have shared access to a class-level dictionary called data_store which stores data rendered by tools for later access by the llm agent. 
- Some examples of current tools include: google custom search engine, wolfram alpha, wikipedia, speech translation, text file translation, mouse control, weather forecast, spotify, youtube, user watch list stock report, etc.
- when the app is running, it listens for user input and waits until it hears the activation word. 
- the activation word, followed by a recognized phrase, will trigger responses from the locally trained model (chatbot_model.keras), and then will call functions based on recognized phrases if applicable. 
- some functions are one-off actions, and others trigger sub-loops such as the 'robot, AI' command which will enter a stateful TTS<>STT chat loop with the Gemini LLM. 
- there is also base code for langchain agents powered by Gemini and GPT-3.5-turbo currently under "agent_one" and "agent_two", but they're not as built out as the Gemini chat loop yet. 
- the user interacts with the app by speaking the activation word (a global constant variable) followed by their phrases. 
- if the user speaks a phrase the bot doesn't recognize, it will save that interaction in the form of a JSON intent template that can then be vetted and corrected by the user and added into its intents.json training data file for the next training session. 
- this "memory logging" has an opportunity to become a more robust and automatic process in a future sprint.

## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT / DEPENDENCIES / INSTALLATION / CONFIG:

```bash
os: macOS Sonoma 14
python 3.11.4

this app requires the following homebrew packages to be installed on the local machine:
brew install portaudio
brew install flac

clone the repository from github: https://github.com/thefilesareinthecomputer/light_ai.git

set up a virtual environment:

cd {REPO_FOLDER}

python3.11 -m venv {VENV_NAME}

source {VENV_NAME}/bin/activate
 
pip install --upgrade pip pip-check-reqs wheel python-dotenv certifi setuptools

pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt

cat .gitignore

create a .env file in the root directory (required variables outlined below):
.env

create a user_persona.py file in the secrets directory (optional, but recommended):
user_persona.py

This version of the app utilizes built-in macOS text to speech (TTS) engine for the bot voice, and will need slight modification on windows and linux with pyttsx3 or other TTS libraries.

Java 17 is required for the neo4j graph database
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html

neo4j community edition is the graph database which will be used to extend long-term memory to the bot via graph RAG. Neo4j is a locally hosted self managed graph database. Download from the URL below and and place in the project root directory after unzipping.
https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/?ref=subscription#community

optionally, within the secrets folder, the user can create a user_persona.py file for themself that is used to calibrate better responses from the bots. the user_persona.py file is a series of dictionaries that can be passed to the bot in prompt templates. some examples are:
user_demographics, 
user_skills_and_experience,
user_interests, 
user_favorite_quotes,
```

## FEATURE BACKLOG (planned additions, improvements, and bug fixes):

```bash
implement rag with the neo4j graph database.
populate the neo4j graph database with nodes and relationships.
gain the ability to ingest knowledge from various media, interpret and summarize it, index it to a knowledge graph using a neo4j database, be able to query it based on user input, and be able to converse about it with the user in real time.
new voices for the speech interface independent of hardware - pyttsx3 or Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. 
tailored news reports. Implement a feature to fetch news from APIs, filtering content based on user preferences or persona. 
communications integration (sms, google voice, whatsapp, signal, email, etc.).
add tqdm progress bars to long running tasks.
translators: currently using the Opus-MT models from transformers for real time speech translation. may need to move to google translate for in-browser, and something like deepl for longer documents.
click a link on the screen by name, and select a text field, check box, or button, etc. based on user speech.
select a tab or window by description based on user speech (a description, such as 'top left of the screen, in back' or 'bottom right of the screen, in front', or 'minimized browser windows' or 'minimized VS code windows' or 'minimized images').
system commands.
meditation coach.
restaurant reservation assistant.
real estate analyzer. Utilize the Zillow API to fetch real estate data and implement ml to analyze deals.
add the ability to follow specific predefined user voice prompts to click windows, open links, type in fields, interact with UIs and apps, edit and crop, adjust settings like brightness and volume, etc. based on voice commands.
add knowledge bases and retrieval augmented generation from custom knowledge in a vector database or graph database with a semantic layer.
vad (voice activity detection) for bot voice and background noice cancellation, or a way to filter out the bot's own voice from the user's input without needing rule-based on/off of the mic input while the bot talks.
integrate it with a bluetooth printer.
add the ability to conduct legal research with websites like casetext, lexisnexis, westlaw, docketbird, pacer, bloomberg law, bna, fastcase, bestlaw, case text, casecheck, case notebook.
more unit tests.
input validations for each function.
performance optimization.
code profiling to identify bottlenecks.
additional secutiry measures - encryption, access control, input sanitation, etc.
to modularize the "chatbot tools initial conversation" we can implement args into the tools and then have the "inquiry" function get user input for each arg in a loop - for arg in args: arg = input("what is your value for " + arg + "?") - then we can pass the args into the tool function.
give the bot the ability to do CRUD operations on the data_store variable in the tools class.
implement asyncio to run the speech recognition and speech output in separate threads so that the bot can listen while it speaks.
implement cachching for speed increase.
```


## CURRENT SPRINT DETAILS:

```bash
the speech timeout settings are still a bit clunky with room for improvement.
occasionaly, the bot is hearing its own output which can interfere with the user input.
building the ui in flet.
add functionality for the agents to operate on the ne04j graph database.
```
